	<h3>Anja Riedmann Portfolio</h3>
	<p>Anja Riedmann is a freelance photographer whose work includes documentary series, portraits, photojournalism and travel. She had a profile piece being published about her and her work so she wanted a website to showcase her photography. It was very important to have her website completed in time as she was anticipating more traffic to her social profiles, which might bring in new clients/projects. I did the design and front-end development.</p>

			<h6>Goals of Project</h6>
			<span>
				<p>Create a clean, easy to navigate website to showcase clients work in the best way possible</p>
				<p>A focus on documentary storytelling, presenting images effectively alongside written content</p>
				<p>Responsive design. Make sure this can be viewed on mobile devices</p>
				<p>Speed. Being an image heavy site it was important to make sure the images loaded as quickly as possible and users could interact with content without being slowed by load times</p>

							<h4>Reseach and Discovery</h4>
							<p>I began my design process by performing research on competitors and other popular photography/portfolio websites to see how others approached certain problems. From this, I was able to see what I thought worked and what was not working. I shortlisted a few of my favourite websites and created a moodboard.</p>

      	<h4>UX & UI</h4>
      	<p>I then focused on the whole user experience, and began brainstorming by doing some  pencil and paper sketches to work out the user flows. The client’s own idea for the design started on the documentary page, and had the navigation along the side. I explored this idea along with several others in my early wireframes. These initial wireframes helped me identify any problems and quickly sketch out creative solutions.</p>

    <li>
      <p>Once I’d gone through several iterations and developed my ideas more, I had a chat with the client where I shared some wireframes and we had a look at my moodboard. I thought it was important to start on an Overview page where visitors could immediately see a variety of her work, rather than the user flow she’d initally proposed. </p><p>After discussing this with her and going through some of the examples from the moodboard, I could see that she liked this idea as well. Our only concern centered around her visual identity not being strong enough and the style of her images and the types of work varying too much to have them all mixed together on a page. With this in mind I iterated further on my original ideas to come to a solution. </p>

      <p>I moved onto Sketch to build more hi fidelity wireframes and develop it a little more. Still focusing purely on the user experience, I kept everything greyscale and did not set the fonts. Once I was happy with how the user flows were feeling, I added my screens to Marvel and had a couple people look at it. I watched as they moved through the website and took notes on any issues (if they were unsure how to get to a previous page, navigation problems, how to reach certain content). I then took my findings back to Sketch to make any changes and began adding styling.</p>

    <h4>Font Family</h4>
		<p>The client initially wanted to go with Helvetica for her font family but after discussing this we agreed it didn’t suit her visual identity and as a young creative, she needed something with more character. The geometric sans serif Euclid Flex worked perfectly here. As a strong, youthful and quirky font it fit really well particularly when used as a header where the character of the font really came through. I used Freight Text for the body copy in the documentary pieces as it was more readable in longer sections and had a bit more serious tone suitable for the subject matter in these sections. </p>
