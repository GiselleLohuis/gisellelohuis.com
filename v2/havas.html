  	<h3>Mobext at Havas</h3>
    <h4>We conceive design and build innovative rich media formats for media campaigns.</h4>
  	<p>Mobext is a mobile-first media agency within Havas. We focus on the production of rich media ads, responsive websites and mobile apps. For our rich media ads we partner with creative agencies who provide video content and campaign assets (logos, images etc) which we then use to design interactive ads for mobile optimised formats. Working as part of a small creative team which includes a developer, another designer and our Head of Product, I design and build mobile ads and also work on the design for websites. Below is a sample of the ads I've designed and built.</p>
