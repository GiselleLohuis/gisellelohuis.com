  	<h3>Web and Mobile Redesigns</h3>
  	<p>Redesigning existing websites and apps is one of the ways I learned how to design. Nearly every online course, book, blog and designer advises to do this, not only to learn, but also just to practice, be creative, and try out new trends. Thinking of ways to improve already great user experiences takes a lot of creativity and problem solving skills and can be quite challenging, so it's something that I try to do regularly. Some of the below redesigns are design tasks from potential employers as well as ones I've done for fun.</p>

						<p>For this exercise my focus was to modernise the interface and make it look more like an iOS app. To do this I started by replacing the dashboard graphics and organising the info in table cells/list as seen in Apple apps. I made several changes to the navigation as well. Having two different types of navigation
						is not something typically used, or recommended. I fixed this by including the hamburger in the bottom navigation as More. The Share page is now accessed in the More section. </p>
